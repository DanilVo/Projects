# Projects Repository
This repository contains a collection of web development projects that I have worked on. Currently, there are two main folders: "clone" and "resume-website".

# Clone Folder
The "clone" folder contains clones of different websites that I have created. There are two sub-folders within this folder, which separate the clones based on the technology used to build them. The first sub-folder contains clones built solely using HTML and CSS, while the second sub-folder contains clones utilizing the Bootstrap framework.

# Resume-Website Folder
The "resume-website" folder contains a website that I have created to showcase information about myself. This website is also built using HTML and CSS and includes all relevant details about me.

# Technologies Used
The projects in this repository were built using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.
